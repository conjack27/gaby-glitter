aboutText: Living our lives we all encounter questions we can only answer for ourselves. Answering these questions reveals our individuality as we are all a product of our being and circumstances. Sharing these autonomous answers is interesting as they give insight into different points of view and offer room for discussion. Creation to me is the methodology to question and reveal myself and reveal humankind to oneself. It is the method to communicate, explore, connect via the universal language of imagination and personal interpretation. To create is my way to ask and give questions to life, to the universe, to existence.Â  I practice across media focusing on the interaction of the human condition, perspectives and environments.
