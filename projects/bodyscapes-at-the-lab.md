description: " During the creation of Bodyscapes, Gaby Jonna attached a
  microphone to her heart area, and a second microphone to her face. Letting the
  rhythm and sounds of her breathing and heart rate guide her movements, Gaby
  allowed the body to speak for itself to then be transferred into fluid forms
  on a canvas. Questions surrounding what makes our bodies move and how we can
  expand our understanding of different forms of self different states of self
  are central to her work. The Bodyscapes series is a form of internal research
  that expands our understanding of self and other, boundaries, bodies, consent
  and human transformation. "
