description: These vessels are a metonym for the primary rigid form of human
  transformation processes. It resembles the interplay between a rigid body, and
  the shape of containment. Exploring the presence and absence of body at the
  same time. A body in search of a place of attention and acknowledgement,
  creating a space of consolation.
