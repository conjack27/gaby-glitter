description: The work Reflections of a Bodily Landscape explores the anatomy of
  human transformation processes – metamorphoses – from a rigid form, into a
  fluid shape. This theme encompasses boundaries, transformation, and trauma.
  Through my work, I research how the body can guide us in venturing into this
  fluid shape.
