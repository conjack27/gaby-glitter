description: The work Reflections of a Bodily Landscape is an exploration into
  the anatomy of human transformation processes – metamorphoses – from a rigid
  form, into a fluid shape. This theme encompasses boundaries, transformation,
  and trauma. Through my work, I research how the body can guide us in venturing
  into this fluid shape.
